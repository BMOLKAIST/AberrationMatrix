# Codes for experimental reflection matrix imaging
Supporting codes for a paper titled "Digital aberration correction for enhanced thick tissue imaging exploiting aberration matrix and tilt-tilt correlation in optical memory effect"

This code is based on the experimental data shared in
Paul Balondrade, Victor Barolle, Nicolas Guigui, Emeric Auriant, Nathan Rougier, Claude Boccara, Mathias Fink, & Alexandre Aubry. (2023). Multi-Spectral Reflection Matrix for Ultra-Fast 3D Label-Free Microscopy [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8407618 , initially prepared for Balondrade, P., Barolle, V., Guigui, N. et al. Multi-spectral reflection matrix for ultrafast 3D label-free microscopy. Nat. Photon. 18, 1097â€“1104 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41566-024-01479-y

To run the code (main.m), you will need distortion_ur_refocused_t122.mat, which can be downloaded from (https://zenodo.org/records/8407618/files/distortion_ur_refocused_t122.mat?download=1)
